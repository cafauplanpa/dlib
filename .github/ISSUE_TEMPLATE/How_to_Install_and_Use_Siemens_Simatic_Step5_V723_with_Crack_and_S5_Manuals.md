The installation process may take several minutes depending on your PC speed and configuration. Once it is done, you will see a message that says "Installation completed successfully". You can then close the installation wizard and eject the virtual CD-ROM drive.

The final step is to apply the crack that will allow you to use the software without activation. To do this, open the folder called Crack on the virtual CD-ROM drive. You will see two files: Step5.exe and Step5.ini.
